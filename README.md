# ESP32 FreeRTOS Examples

A collection of **ESP-IDF FreeRTOS** examples for quick and easy code access. 
The goal is to provide small, clean snippets that demonstrate FreeRTOS primitives and common patterns on ESP32.

## Structure

- **Micro-Examples/** – focused, minimal examples (tasks, queues, semaphores, event groups, timers, stream/message buffers).  
- **Generic-Examples/** – combined use cases that show how primitives work together.
